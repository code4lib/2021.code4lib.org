                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>
                  We are a community of developers and technologists for galleries, libraries, museums, and archives. Code4Lib began as a simple mailing list in 2003, and has grown to become a vibrant community of more than 3,500.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Code4Lib is a community, not an organization. There are no officers or by-laws, but the Code4Lib community has demonstrated strong commitment to the following principles over the years:
                  <ul>
                    <li>openness and collaboration</li>
                    <li>diversity and inclusiveness</li>
                    <li>technical excellence</li>
                    <li>a supportive and nurturing space for newcomers</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>About the Conference</h2>
                <p>
                  Each year, the Code4Lib conference helps revitalize the community as participants meet in person to discuss new and ongoing projects in a single-track format with short presentations and talks. It also provides in-depth participatory learning experiences through its volunteer-led post-conference programs, and offers ad-hoc breakout sessions focused on collaboration around topics of interest.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Conference speakers and programs are chosen by a voting process open to the entire community.</li>
                    <li>Sessions are live-streamed to support remote attendance. Beginning in 2016, the stream was captioned in real-time to promote accessibility, and the community is committed to continuing this service.</li>
                    <!--<li>Diversity scholarships help members of underrepresented communities attend the conference and take advantage of learning and networking opportunities. Many individual community members donate personally to increase the number of scholarships.</li>-->
                    <li>Our single-track format promotes broad sharing of ideas; the 20-minute time limit for presentations allows topics on a wide variety of technologies.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                  Code4Lib held its first face-to-face meeting in 2005 in Chicago. The first official annual conference was held in 2006 in Corvallis, Oregon, with 150 attendees. Past conferences typically sell out quickly.
                </p>

                <p>
                   The {{site.data.conf.year}} conference will be our first online conference. The conference is gender-diverse, with approximately 48% women attendees.
                </p>

                <h2>Impact of Support</h2>
                <p>
                  Code4Lib offers a nexus for technical professionals from galleries, libraries, museums, and archives. Through sponsoring the conference, you can help create connections between projects and individuals, encourage good ideas to cross the gaps between subcommunities, and spawn new ideas. You can also help practitioners level up their skills in technology as well as collaboration with professionals in different areas of expertise.
                </p>

                <!-- <p>
                  The Code4Lib community takes inclusion and equity seriously. By sponsoring Code4Lib's diversity scholarships, you can help ensure that the attendees better represent the mix of people that galleries, libraries, museums, and archives technology should both embody and serve.
                </p> -->

                <p>
                  Your sponsorship of the conference can also provide immediate, concrete benefits to you and your organization. Code4Lib attendees include active practitioners who may be interested in your product, open source project, or services as well as department heads and senior administrators (approximately 17% of attendees last year) who make purchase decisions. Sponsors are strongly encouraged to send their staff to the conference to take advantage of access to the people and ideas who make up the Code4Lib community.
                </p>
