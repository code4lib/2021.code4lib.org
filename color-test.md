- Oxford Blue (#061A40) or Dark Jungle Green (#041F1E)can be used as a background.

- "Cultured" white (#F5F5F5) can be used as a foreground with [Oxford Blue (#061A40)](https://github.com/code4lib/2021.code4lib.org/wiki/2021---Banner-and-Color-scheme) or Dark Jungle Green (#041F1E) background with sufficient contrast to WCAG 2.0 AAA for regular font, larger font, and
visual components (icons, etc.).

- Turquoise (#00D5C0) can be used as a foreground with Oxford Blue (#061A40) or Dark Jungle Green (#041F1E) background
with sufficient contrast to WCAG 2.0 AAA for regular font, larger font, and visual components (icons, etc.).

- Shocking Crayola Pink (#FA62F0) can be used as a foreground with Dark Jungle Green (#041F1E) background for WCAG AA,
but it does not meet WCAG AAA for regular font (large font and visual components like icons okay).

- For any other combination (e.g. "Cultured" white (#F5F5F5) on Turquoise (#00D5C0) , Shocking Crayola Pink (#FA62F0) on
Oxford Blue (#061A40), do a test.)

- Feel free to use shades or tints of colors to achieve accessible results.

                    Alison Langmead holds a joint faculty appointment between the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences
                    and the School of Computing and Information at the University of Pittsburgh. She teaches and
                    researches in the field of the digital humanities, focusing especially on applying digital methods
                    mindfully within the context of visual and material culture studies. For the Department of Art
                    History and Architecture, Alison serves as the Director of the Visual Media Workshop (VMW). The
                    mission of the VMW is to develop and encourage the creation of innovative methods for producing,
                    disseminating, and preserving the academic work using digital technologies as a fundamental
                    component of our scholarly toolkit. To achieve these objectives, she directs a
                    technologically-focused environment of collaboration and creativity where students and faculty from
                    a number of departments across the University come together to work on projects that apply digital
                    methods and techniques with focus and intention. For the School of Computing and Information (SCI),
                    Alison researches the relationship between the historical practice of information management and
                    digital computing, both as a historical narrative and also as a complex, changing process in
                    contemporary America. This research, plus all of the theories, concepts, and models that she teaches
                    at SCI, are put into daily practice in her work directing the VMW.
