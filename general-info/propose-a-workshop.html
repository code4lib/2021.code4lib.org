                Post-conferences can be scheduled in 90 minute increments up to six hours in length and will occur on {{ site.data.conf.days.last.weekday }}, {{ site.data.conf.days.last.date }}, {{ site.data.conf.year }}.

                The post-conference sessions give folks a space to share and build
                knowledge, as well as to teach attendees new skills relevant to library
                technology. Post-conference sessions can range from workshops to working
                sessions. We welcome a variety of ideas and encourage submissions from
                first-time presenters and members of groups not well-represented within the
                Code4Lib community, including but not limited to: women, people of color,
                people with disabilities, LGBT+.

                If you're looking for inspiration, there are many great examples of post-conferences from previous years.

                We are taking proposals through
                {{ site.data.conf.workshop-proposals.end-date | date: '%A, %B %d' }}.
                After a period of public voting on workshops, we hope to confirm sessions with
                facilitators shortly after.
