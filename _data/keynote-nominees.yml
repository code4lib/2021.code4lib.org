    Regina Gong is the Open Educational Resources (OER) & Student Success Librarian at Michigan State University (MSU) Libraries. Before joining MSU, Regina was the OER Project Manager at Lansing Community College (LCC) where she led a very successful OER initiative. Regina is well-known in the open education community and has done numerous national presentations and webinars on OER. She is a staunch advocate of openness, equity, and access through her involvement on the SPARC Open Education Advisory Group (2019-2022), SPARC Steering Committee, and Executive Council member of the Community College Consortium for Open Educational Resources (CCCOER) where she served as VP for professional development. She is also in the MI Statewide OER Steering Committee; 2019 Open Education Conference Program Committee, and an OER Research Group Fellow. Regina obtained her Masters in Library and Information Science (MLIS) at Wayne State University and is currently pursuing Ph.D. in the Higher, Adult, and Lifelong Education (HALE) Program at Michigan State University. I believe that Regina Gong will bring an important viewpoint related to open education and access and the role of libraries/museums of all types to consider.

- name: "Chuck Pell"

    "A confessed 'congenital geek,' Chuck is inventor, artist, scientist and expressive raconteur. As a practitioner of Design Coup d'œil (the habit of seeing overarching structural issues at a glance), Chuck seeks the essential core of any system, whether science, art, or technology. He is most at home in novel situations, figuring things out on the fly. These tendencies have led Chuck to garner experience in surgical robotics, functional morphology, biomechanics, fluid dynamics, miniature robotics, autonomous underwater vehicles, ballistics, maritime communications, entertainment effects, teaching, design (graphic, exhibit and industrial) and filmmaking. Never at rest, he’s had 100 shows of his paintings and sculpture, with dozens of papers published in biology, engineering and patents issued or pending. Having raised millions for research and now on his third startup, Chuck has the nagging suspicion he’s become a serial entrepreneur." (excerpted from Chuck's TEDMED bio). Chuck Pell is a sculptor, roboticist, Emmy-winning television host, and force of nature. His philosophies towards creativity and invention include: uncover hidden assumptions, pursue surprise, and "fail early and often, when it's cheap." His passionate approach to real-world problem solving has a lot to offer the world of GLAM-tech; combined with an avowed love of technology, libraries, and knowledge generally, his perspective will bring a wealth of insight and creativity to the Code4Lib community. Chuck is 1/4 of the way to an EGOT and was formerly the consulting scientist for an asteroid mining company.

- name: "Bryan Alexander"

    Bryan Alexander is a futurist, writer, speaker and scholar at the University of Georgetown. I first met Bryan when he worked for NITLE, an organization that encouraged collaboration and use of emerging technologies among liberal arts colleges. He led several workshops on games in education, Web 2.0 and digital scholarship, all well before any could be considered mainstream. Our paths crossed again when I helped to contribute to the New Media Consortium’s Horizon Report where Bryan was a long-time advisor providing insight on how potentially disruptive technologies could influence libraries, museums and higher education. Recently Bryan has become well known due to the publication of his book Academia Next where he outlined possible future scenarios and their effects on academia. Included is a scenario that considered how a pandemic could change higher ed. His analysis pre-COVID-19 was eerily accurate and earned him interviews with NPR, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal and others. Bryan is an exceptionally engaging speaker, regularly citing examples from the audience during his talk and integrating questions mid-stream. His “brooding”, as he refers to it, is mixed with a personal optimism that is contagious. While an excellent speaker, he brings much more to the conference. Every time I have seen him, he has attended the conference as an active participant and used his vast personal network to connect people with similar interests and problems. If Bryan is selected as the speaker, the conference as a whole will benefit greatly.

    Tatiana Mac (she/they) is an independent American engineer. She is an open source maintainer who created and is building Self-Defined, a modern dictionary about us; and Devs of Colour, a database that will prioritise finding undiscovered Black/brown talent through a thoughtful search algorithm. As a consultant, she works directly with organisations to build clear and coherent products and design systems. An international keynote speaker, she speaks on the intersection of technology and ethics, examining how our products both fit and define our social and environmental settings. You can view her recorded talks on YouTube. She believes the trifecta of accessibility, performance, and inclusion can work symbiotically to improve our social landscape digitally and physically. When ethically-minded, she thinks technologists can dismantle exclusionary systems in favour of community-focused, inclusive ones.
