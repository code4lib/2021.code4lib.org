title: Navigating without a map&#58; discovery in a world beyond subject access
---
<p>What do you do when your library has a unique collection, like ETDs -- but it unfortunately does not have high-quality subject metadata? How can you make that content discoverable and (dare I say) engaging?</p><p></p><p>In this talk, we'll show a machine learning approach that situates a collection within a conceptual space. We'll then explore that space, using a variety of visual and textual approaches, and see how it can be the back end for possibilities as diverse as...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visualizing a whole collection at a glance, and seeing stories in it</li>
  <li>A recommendation engine (if you like X, try reading Y!)</li>
  <li>A way to find people with shared interests</li>
  <li>A quick-and-dirty literature review</li>
 </ul>
