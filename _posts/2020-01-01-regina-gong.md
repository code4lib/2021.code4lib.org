Education is a human right and educational opportunities should be available to all learners globally. How does open education make this idea possible? How can it be a catalyst for change? Open education is built on the traditions of knowledge sharing of resources, practices, and tools to improve educational access and equity. It enables educators and learners to have the freedom and agency to pursue knowledge creation and collaboration that best fits their context. Together, we will take a look at how open education through the use open educational resources (OER), open educational practices (OEP), and open tools embedded in these materials and practices contribute to effective learning, improved pedagogy, accessibility, and equity.
