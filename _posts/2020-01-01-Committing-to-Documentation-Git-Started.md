title: Committing to Documentation&#58; Git Started
---
Documentation is a critical part of developing, implementing, and maintaining collections, systems, and institutional knowledge within archival programs large and small. The lack of proper documentation is a common issue that undermines even the most robust preservation workflows, and is perhaps one of the least exciting and most tedious aspects of preservation. For many, the hardest part is choosing a platform and getting started, and this workshop aims to make that task less daunting by providing attendee&rsquo;s with the skills they need to set up a simple docs site. Attendees will learn Markdown, Jekyll, Git and GitHub Pages, and some approaches to technical writing and structure as they create their own static site for an archival project or workflow they&rsquo;ve been aching to start documenting.
