title: A Plea for Implementation Management
---
As part of the abrupt transition to being a remote workforce, we were given a number of tools to help us work from home. However, handing someone a login to a program does not mean that they can use it. It is becoming unfortunately commonplace for software and systems roll-outs to involve nothing more than handing out account credentials and possibly sharing a link to a one-hour recorded video. Practice (repetition) is key to learning, yet staff are shown how to do something once and then wonder why they are failing to execute it flawlessly afterwards. It is rare that implementation is handled appropriately and this, I argue, is a serious waste of money. It also damages morale and it leads to further promotion of self-doubt (impostor syndrome) among staff. While I am still a new manager, I know it is important to set staff up for success rather than letting them flail into failure. In this presentation, I will cover lessons I learned while unofficially coaching staff through implementation of new tools during 2020.
