title: Fail4Lib 2021&#58; The one after 2020
---
<p>Everyone experiences failure in their professional lives, but no one likes to talk about it. When we see failure approaching, we distance ourselves, avert our eyes, or -- if we're in its path -- brace for the worst. But failure has intrinsic value and is an essential step on the path to professional and organizational success. And since it&rsquo;s inevitable, we ought to learn how to look back on our failures to derive value from them, and how to look ahead so that our past failures can inform our future successes.</p>
<p>Fail4Lib, now in its 9th year, is the perennial Code4Lib preconference dedicated to discussing and coming to terms with the failures that we all encounter in our professional lives. It is a safe space for us to explore failure, to talk about our own experiences with failure, and to encourage enlightened risk taking. The goal of Fail4Lib is for participants &ndash; and their organizations &ndash; to get better at failing gracefully, so that when we do fail, we do so in a way that moves us forward. And in a year with plenty of failure to reflect on, the ability to make the most of failure is a valuable asset. First-timers and Fail4Lib veterans are welcome!</p>
