title: Ethics in web design
---
<p>Accessibility creates a better web experience for everyone. Optimizations likewise impacts marginalized groups of people, such as those experiencing reduced access to the Internet for socio-economic issues or geographic disparities in infrastructure services. Security and privacy standards can help those that are less familiar with the Internet. Mindfulness puts human needs before profit and ethical design recommends reducing distractions, which also positively impacts people that experience attention or anxiety disorders.</p><p></p><p>When thinking about the various vectors of web issues and writing a personal ethical web manifesto, I noticed that so many of the guidelines interlace and support many groups of people, especially the vulnerable and people with disabilities. Iâ€™ll take a look at the different lens of ethical web design and how they intersect to create better experiences for everyone, but especially those with disabilities, and how we might put them into practice.</p>
