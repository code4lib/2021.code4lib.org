title: Code that Lasts&#58; Sustainable And Usable Open Source Code
---
I have realized that the open source projects I am most proud of are a few that have existed for years now, increasing in popularity, with very little maintenance required. Including traject and bento_search. While community aspects matter for open source sustainability, the task gets so much easier when the code requires less effort to keep alive, for maintainers and utilizers. Using these projects as examples, can we as developers identify what makes code &quot;inexpensive&quot; to use and maintain over the long haul with little &quot;churn&quot;, and how to do that?
