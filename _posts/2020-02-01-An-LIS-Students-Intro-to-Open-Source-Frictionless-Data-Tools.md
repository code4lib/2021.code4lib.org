title: An LIS Student’s Intro to Open Source Frictionless Data Tools
---
I’ve been a Frictionless Data Reproducible Research Fellow at Open Knowledge Foundation (http://okfn.org) for six months. Throughout the fellowship, I’ve been learning and using open source frictionless tools which have broad applications in the library environment. The Frictionless Data (https://frictionlessdata.io/) initiative at Open Knowledge Foundation aims to reduce friction in working with data, with a goal to go from messy data to insight faster. Given by a library science student aiming to learn how to help researchers practice reproducibility and data management, this talk will introduce the Code4Lib community to the frictionless toolkit and provide information about the fellowship for early career researchers and LIS students with an interest in data librarianship.
