title: Backlog Monster! Or, The Virtue of Muddling Through
---
<p>There is something big lurking in your backlog, something that darkens your every work day. Maybe it’s remediation you’ve been putting off for years, or unfinished business from a big migration. Nothing depends on taming the monster, but life would be easier if you did. </p><p></p><p>In our case it was barcodes—tens of thousands of off-site barcodes in the ILS but unavailable to the Aeon requesting system. Every request fulfillment necessitated a tedious manual lookup. Merging the data by hand would have taken untold months of staff hours, and with no common identifiers across systems an automated solution seemed out of reach.</p><p></p><p>By piecing together and adapting tooling from other efforts (Python, Google Sheets, regex), we struck a productive balance between automation and manual work and, while working remotely during COVID-19, added 25K barcodes to our most in-demand collections. </p><p></p><p>The presentation outlines the solution we landed on and makes a limited case for an ad hoc, “bricoleur” approach that eschews sustainability in favor of near-term effectiveness and progressive learning. You may never use your one-off tools again, but you will carry forward something for the next project, and further lower the barrier to taming the next backlog monster.</p>
