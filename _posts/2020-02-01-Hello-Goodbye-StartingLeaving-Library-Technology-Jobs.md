title: Hello, Goodbye&#58; Starting/Leaving Library Technology Jobs
---
Starting a new job is an exciting time full of new people, technologies, and projects; leaving a job is an often bittersweet time of trying to wrap up projects, saying goodbye to people, and trying to document technology. This talk will explore both sides of this equation of stepping into and out of code and technology focused roles with a particular focus on positions in small to medium sized libraries where there is likely only one person doing this work with no one to provide on-the-job training. We will explore ways to lay the groundwork for your successor and how to effectively start your new library tech job. The speakers will share their recent experiences leaving and starting the same job in a medium-sized academic library including what worked and what could have been done better.
