title: Replacing Worldcat with a GitHub Repo
---
<p>In October of 2020, the "Free-Programming-Books" repo on GitHub processed over 1,300 pull requests, expanding its coverage to over 3,770 free books, 1,254 free courses, and 822 other resources in a total of 35 spoken languages. The repo, managed by the Free Ebook Foundation, received contributions (additions, deletions, corrections and other improvements) from 338 individual around the world.</p><p></p><p>What would it take to use GitHub-style workflow for the maintenance of a larger database? Could we do something similar for all free ebooks (the openly-licensed-ebook-database behind Unglue.it will reach 100,000 volumes in 2021)? What are the limits to git-based crowd-sourced database maintenance? Can we foresee a day when the big library knowledgebases - like Worldcat with 500M records - are replaced by something like free-programming books?</p><p></p><p>In this talk, I introduce a few concepts that help us think about these questions, in an attempt to imagine the coming age of "git-cats".</p>
