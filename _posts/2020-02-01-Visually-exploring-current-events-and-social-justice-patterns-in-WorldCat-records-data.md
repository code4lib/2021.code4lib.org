title: Visually exploring current events and social justice patterns in WorldCat records data
---
<p>Machine learning, data science and advanced data visualization techniques have made huge strides and are now more widely available than ever. This talk focuses on showing how machine learning algorithms and data visualizations can showcase ways in which the data stored in OCLC's WorldCat records relates to current events. I will show patterns in holdings related to police brutality, racial justice, COVID-19 and works by Black creators. </p><p></p><p>I will be demonstrating how I used Tableau, RStudio, python and machine learning algorithms to visualize and analyze collections data across geographical regions and subject headings. I will also explore any relationships or commonalities among the types of libraries which carry materials that reflect current events and focus on social justice.</p>
