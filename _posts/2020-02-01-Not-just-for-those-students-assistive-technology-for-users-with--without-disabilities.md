title: Not just for "those" students&#58; assistive technology for users with & without disabilities
---
How do assistive technologies intersect with diversity initiatives? How can libraries use and promote assistive technology to create inclusive environments? How can we use assistive technology to facilitate the reading and writing needs of our patrons? Two librarians from California State University-Dominguez Hills will share tips for launching and marketing a new technology into the library and campus using a case study of their recent work to expand the usage of assistive technology to provide value-added services that promote student success. Learn about an interdisciplinary approach to disability services and how to advocate for more resources for your users. You will leave this session with a better understanding of how to leverage campus partnerships to improve your libraryâ€™s offerings to students with and without disabilities.
